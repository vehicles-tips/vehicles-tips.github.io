    <section id="problems" class="section">
      <h2>2. What to Do If a Problem Arises</h2>
      <p>Contact us immediately if an issue occurs after our work. A diagnostic fee applies if it’s a new or unrelated problem, or if recommendations were ignored. If another shop works on the same issue before our inspection, the warranty is void.</p>

    <section id="thirdparty" class="section">
      <h2>3. Third-Party Repairs</h2>
      <p>Taking your vehicle to another workshop for the same issue before contacting us voids your warranty.</p>

    <section id="workmanship" class="section">
      <h2>4. Parts & Workmanship</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Workmanship warranty: 3 months or 3,000 miles (whichever comes first).</li>
        <li>No warranty on customer-supplied parts. If a part fails, new labor charges apply.</li>
        <li>A/C repairs: workmanship warranty applies. A/C recharges: no warranty or refunds.</li>
        <li>We only discuss matters with the person on the original invoice.</li>

    <section id="diagnostics" class="section">
      <h2>5. Diagnostics</h2>
      <p>Diagnostics may not resolve every issue in a single repair due to vehicle complexity. Incorrect customer self-diagnosis is not our responsibility. Pre-existing issues are excluded.</p>

    <section id="payments" class="section">
      <h2>7. Payments & Refunds</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Payment is due in full upon completion. Stopping a job does not cancel labor charges.</li>
        <li>Refunds require proof from a licensed mechanic and a printed receipt.</li>
        <li>If repairs pause due to issues beyond our control, half the labor cost is due that day; the balance upon completion.</li>
